The OSG Virtual School 2021 will prepare you to use high throughput computing (HTC) \u2014 whether on a local system or using OSG \u2014 to run large-scale research simulation, analysis, and other applications for cutting-edge science. Through lecture, demonstration, hands-on exercises, and a personalized learning plan that includes one-on-one and small-group consulting with experienced OSG staff, you will learn to harness HTC systems and apply them to your own computational research. The School is ideal for graduate students in any research area for whom large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process; we also consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff! This virtual offering has been tuned for remote participation, with the goal of helping attendees get their own work running within the 2-week period, and is not merely a translation of the in-person program (last offered in 2019 ). The Virtual School will be held the weeks of August 2\u20136 and 9\u201313. The event is free and materials will be posted publicly. A selective application process is required for full participation, which includes access to HTC experts and to HTC systems via the Center for High Throughput Computing and OSG Connect service (the latter otherwise available to researchers working on a U.S.-based academic, government, or non-profit research project). While no travel is involved and the schedule allows for some flexibility, accepted applicants will be asked to commit at least 20 hours each week. You can view the high-level schedule for 2021 , and we expect the detailed schedule and materials to be similar to the OSG Virtual School Pilot 2020 . Note: We hope to return to an in-person OSG User School in 2022! Applications \u00b6 Applications are now closed. We received a large number of applications this year, so thanks to everyone for your enthusiastic interest! If still needed, have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to user-school@opensciencegrid.org (any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or plain text best). Ask someone who knows you professionally \u2014 ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify your name and \u201cOSG Virtual School 2021\u201d in the email subject and letter. We plan to review applications in early June and send out our decisions by mid-June or so. We will contact all applicants once decisions have been made. Thank you for your patience! Contact Us \u00b6 The OSG Virtual School is part of the OSG Outreach Area \u2014 please visit that site to learn about past OSG Schools.
