The OSG Virtual School 2021 will prepare you to use high throughput computing (HTC) systems \u2014 locally or using the OSG \u2014 to run large-scale research simulation, analysis, and other applications for cutting-edge science. Through lecture, demonstration, hands-on exercises, and one-on-one consulting with experienced OSG staff, you will learn to harness HTC systems and apply them to your own research computing work. The event has been tuned for remote participation and is not merely a translation of the in-person program! The Virtual School will be held the weeks of August 2\u20136 and 9\u201313 . You can view the high-level schedule now. Participation in the event is free, but a selective application process is required. The School is ideal for graduate students in any research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff. While no travel is involved and the schedule allows for some flexibility, the expectation is that participants commit to about 20 hours each week. Applications will open in late April or early May; check back here then. Note: We hope to return to an in-person OSG User School in 2022! Contact Us \u00b6 The OSG Virtual School is part of the OSG Outreach Area \u2014 please visit that site to learn about other OSG Outreach activities.
