Due May 28 \u2013 see below for link. Transform your research with vast amounts of computing! The OSG Virtual School 2021 will prepare you to use high throughput computing (HTC) \u2014 whether on a local system or using the OSG \u2014 to run large-scale research simulation, analysis, and other applications for cutting-edge science. Through lecture, demonstration, hands-on exercises, and a personalized learning plan that includes one-on-one and small-group consulting with experienced OSG staff, you will learn to harness HTC systems and apply them to your own computational research. The School is ideal for graduate students in any research area for whom large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process; we also consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff! This virtual offering has been tuned for remote participation, with the goal of helping attendees get their own work running within a two-week period, and is not merely a translation of the in-person program (last offered in 2019 ). The Virtual School will be held the weeks of August 2\u20136 and 9\u201313. Participation is free and materials will be posted publicly. A selective application process is required for live participation, which includes access to HTC systems via the Center for High Throughput Computing and OSG Connect service (otherwise available to researchers working on a U.S.-based academic, government, or non-profit research project). While no travel is involved and the schedule allows for some flexibility, accepted applicants will be asked to commit at least 20 hours each week. You can view the high-level schedule for 2021 , and we expect the detailed schedule and materials to be similar to the 2020 OSG Virtual School Pilot . Note: We hope to return to an in-person OSG User School in 2022! Applications \u00b6 Applications are now open. The deadline for applications is Friday, 28 May 2021. Submit your application soon to ensure consideration! To apply, complete both of the steps below (in parallel, if you like): Complete the online application form (link goes to Qualtrics website, which hosts the application) Have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to user-school@opensciencegrid.org (any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or plain text best) For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally \u2014 ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify your name and \u201cOSG Virtual School 2021\u201d in the subject line and letter, so that we can associate your application and letter. Ideal candidates will: Be graduate students doing research or support staff helping researchers (but see below) Need large amounts of computing, which could transform research or open new paths to discovery Have basic experience with the Linux command line (or learn beforehand) Be able to commit to at least 20 hours each week for the School dates Not a graduate student or support staff? We consider applications from advanced undergraduates, especially those who are involved in graduate-level research or coursework; make a good case for yourself! Also, we consider people in other groups (post-doctoral researchers, faculty, researchers, other staff, etc.), especially if you convince us that this opportunity is likely to have a significant effect on your work or research, or that of others. Contact Us \u00b6 The OSG Virtual School is part of the OSG Outreach Area \u2014 please visit that site to learn about past OSG Schools. If you have any questions about the event, feel free to email us: user-school@opensciencegrid.org OSGUserSchool","title":"Home"},{"location":"#osg-virtual-school-2021","text":"Applications now open!
