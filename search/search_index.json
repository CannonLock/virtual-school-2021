Based on experiences with the successful the OSG Virtual School Pilot 2020 , the goal is to provide a training and consulting event in which each participant works to get their research computing running within the two week period. We think that this approach is a better use of the virtual format rather than simply translating the User School for remote participation. The Virtual School will be held the weeks of August 2\u20136 and 9\u201313. While no travel is involved and the schedule allows for some flexibility, the expectation is that participants commit to about 20 hours each week. Thus, the time commitment is similar to the in-person User School. Applications will open in late April or early May. A link to the application system will be posted here for the entire application period. Until then, there is a high-level schedule available so that you can get a better sense of what the Virtual School is about. Contact Us \u00b6 The OSG Virtual School is part of the OSG Outreach Area \u2014 please visit that site to learn about other OSG Outreach activities.
