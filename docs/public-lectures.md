# OSGVS21 Public Lectures

The OSG User School is our premier training program for researchers,
facilitators, and others who are interested in learning more about how to
use High Throughput Computing to advance research.  This year&rsquo;s program is
online again and the application process is complete.  BUT we have some
exciting news about sharing the OSG School with the entire community!

**For the first time, the OSG Virtual School 2021 will open its core lectures
live to the public.**

The public lectures are excellent learning opportunities for students and
researchers who could not be full participants of the School.  The sessions
are also well suited for those interested in learning more about High
Throughput Computing, OSG, HTCondor, or leveraging any of these in your
computing research.  Topics include:

* The main concepts of High Throughput Computing (HTC)
* The basics of using HTCondor
* Getting started on OSG, a national distributed HTC infrastructure for
   Open Science
* How to prepare software for use in HTC systems
* Handling data (input and output) in HTC systems

The public lectures are held daily, August 2-6, from 2:30-4:00 pm US
Central Time.  

The detailed [schedule](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/49686/timetable/) is available
on the Indico site.

In addition, the lectures will be recorded and posted on the School website
eventually, along with the complete set of exercises.  While full
participants also have priority access to experts, personalized learning
plans, and small-group learning sessions, by opening lectures up to the
public, a great deal of the School content will be available to everyone.
