# OSGVS21 Schedule

This page contains schedule details for **full, invited participants** of the OSG Virtual School 2021,
who were selected following a Spring 2021 application process.

SOME presentations will presented publicly. For information about access to public lectures and demonstrations,
visit [the Indico scheduling site](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/49686/);
note that public attendance requires free registration on that site.

## Week 1: August 2&ndash;6

**Note:** Lectures and demonstrations this week are repeated each day.
The first instance is for invited School participants only,
and the second instance will also be open to the general public who have registered in advance.
Invited participants may attend one or both times.

During the times marked as &ldquo;Staff available&rdquo;,
School staff will be monitoring email and the OSG School Slack for questions.
So these are good times to work on School-related activities&nbsp;&mdash;
such as exercises or applying things to your own work.
