Software Exercise 4.1: Singularity Examples on OSG Connect
============================================================

Background
----------

Containers are another way to manage software installations. This guide shows how to use pre-existing containers to run jobs on the OSG.

One caveat for using containers: not all systems will support them. HTCondor has built-in features for using Docker and many OSG resources have Singularity installed, but they are not always available everywhere. 

Setup
-----

1. Make sure you are logged into `login04.osgconnect.net`. 

1. To get an idea on what container images are available on the OSG, 
take a look at the directory path `/cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid`.
