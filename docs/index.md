# OSG Virtual School 2021

The OSG User School for 2021 will be virtual again,
so we call it the OSG Virtual School 2021.

Based on experiences with the successful
[the OSG Virtual School Pilot 2020](https://opensciencegrid.org/virtual-school-pilot-2020/),
the goal is to provide a training and consulting event
in which each participant works to get their research computing running within the two week period.
We think that this approach is a better use of the virtual format
rather than simply translating the User School for remote participation.

The Virtual School will be held the weeks of August 2&ndash;6 and 9&ndash;13.
While no travel is involved and the schedule allows for some flexibility,
the expectation is that participants commit to about 20 hours each week.
Thus, the time commitment is similar to the in-person User School.

Applications will open in late April or early May.
A link to the application system will be posted here for the entire application period.

Until then, there is [a high-level schedule](schedule.md) available
so that you can get a better sense of what the Virtual School is about.
