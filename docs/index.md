# OSG Virtual School 2021

<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Transform your research with vast amounts of computing!</p>

The OSG Virtual School 2021 will prepare you to use high throughput computing (HTC)&nbsp;&mdash;
whether on a 'local' system or using the 
[Open Science Grid (OSG)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2PzIy-vvaE&list=PLBWb4iScSWcPy7LQ4BuXmm8Z2xO4ZW1J_)&nbsp;&mdash;
to run large-scale research simulation, analysis, and other applications for cutting-edge science.
Through lecture, demonstration, hands-on exercises, and peronalized consulting with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn to harness HTC systems and apply them to your own research computing work.
The School is ideal for graduate students in any research area for whom beyond-the-desktop computing 
is a vital part of the research process; we also accept applications from advanced undergraduates, 
post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff!

_We hope to return to an in-person OSG User School in 2022!_ This virtual offering has been tuned for remote 
participation, with the goal of helping attendees get their own work running within a two-week period, and 
is not merely a translation of the in-person program (last offered in [2019](https://opensciencegrid.org/user-school-2019/)).

**The Virtual School will be held the weeks of August 2&ndash;6 and 9&ndash;13**. 
Participation is **free** and with materials publicly posted. A selective application process is required 
for live participation, which includes access to HTC systems via the 
[Center for High Throughput Computing](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/approach.shtml) (at UW-Madison)
and [OSG Connect](https://www.osgconnect.net/) service (otherwise available to researchers working for 
on US-based academic/govt/non-profit research project).

While **no travel is involved and the schedule allows for some flexibility**,
applicants are asked to indicate a commitment of about 20 hours each week. You can view [the high-level schedule](schedule.md), 
as well as the detailed schedule and materials from the 
[2020 OSG Virtual School Pilot](https://opensciencegrid.org/virtual-school-pilot-2020/) 
This year's schedule may differ slightly, but materials will also be posted within weeks of the live event. 
Thus, applicants are asked to discuss how the 
live experience will be important to their success, including live presentations and discussion, 
personalized consulting, and designated co-working times.

**Applications will open in early May**; check back here then.
