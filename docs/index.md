# OSG Virtual School 2021

<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Transform your research with vast amounts of computing!</p>

The OSG Virtual School 2021 will prepare you to use high throughput computing (HTC) systems&nbsp;&mdash;
locally or using the OSG&nbsp;&mdash;
to run large-scale research simulation, analysis, and other applications for cutting-edge science.
Through lecture, demonstration, hands-on exercises, and one-on-one consulting with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn to harness HTC systems and apply them to your own research computing work.
The event has been tuned for remote participation and is not merely a translation of the in-person program!

The Virtual School will be held **the weeks of August 2&ndash;6 and 9&ndash;13**.
You can view [the high-level schedule](schedule.md) now.

Participation in the event is free, but a selective application process is required.
The School is ideal for graduate students in any research domain
where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process,
plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff.
While no travel is involved and the schedule allows for some flexibility,
the expectation is that participants commit to about 20 hours each week.

**Applications will open in late April or early May;** check back here then.

Note: We hope to return to an in-person OSG User School in 2022!
